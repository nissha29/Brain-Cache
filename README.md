## üí° How It Works
Brain Cache transforms your content into vector embeddings using state-of-the-art language models. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of your content, enabling intelligent retrieval beyond simple keyword matching. When you query your brain, the system finds the most semantically relevant information regardless of exact wording.
